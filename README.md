# Quest-For-Perfection
AJ Giron's Create Project | CSCI 101 Spring 2022

Fight against your foes in a turn based, strategic, upgrade-focused and colorful game! 

This project is made entirely in Python as my 2022 Computer Science 101 Create Project, and was presented in the Spring 2022 Colorado School of Mines Computer Science 
Showcase. This game is built in the Pygame engine and is only playable with an installed Pygame library. All code and art created by AJ Giron.
